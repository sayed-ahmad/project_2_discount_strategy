# project_2_discount_strategy
This is a project I worked to analyze the data and find the answer to the question "whether or not it’s beneficial to discount products".
## About the project
As a data analyst in a company, I first cleaned the data observinf the quality aspects of the data. After cleaning, I worked on analyzing the data to give insights on the discount strategy. Then I presented the result of my analysis to the company board.

# Business aspect of the project
I will be providing clarity on the following aspect:
- How products should be classified into different categories to simplify reports and analysis.
- What is the distribution of product prices across different categories.
- How many products are being discounted?
- How big are the offered discounts as a percentage of the product prices.
- How seasonality and special dates (Christmas, Black Friday) affect sales.
- How could data collection be improved.
